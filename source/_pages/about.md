#### Hello and welcome to the Eagle Rex Cycling Club!

Eagle Rex is a friendly and diverse cycling club, founded in 2021 and based in London, UK

The club is open to everyone who wants to gradually return to regular exercise, stay active, keep fit, support their own health, well-being and remain in good shape.
